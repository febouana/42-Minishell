# 42-minishell



Minishell is the first team project in the 42 common core, focused on developing a robust parsing system to interpret and execute user commands, following the POSIX Bash model. The goal is to create a basic shell in C, 
We must implement builtin commands such as `pwd`, `cd`, `echo`, `env`, `export`, `unset`, and `exit`, while also supporting pipes, redirections, and environment variable expansion. Additionally, a command history system allows users to navigate through previous inputs. This is our own little Bash!
